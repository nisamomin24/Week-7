CVSS:
CVSS (common vulnerability scoring system) is the way to provide key elements of a vulnerability that score it from 0 to 1 to determine the severity of that vulnerability. Many security teams use CVSS in the vulnerability management process such as incident response, detecting faults and proposing required mitigations. (Miguel, 2022)
Misdirecting Priority Risks
Recent researches and analysis have identified several deficiencies in the popular CVS system and doesn’t justify its algorithm to be empirical and formal. The biggest concern for the CVSS is it scores severity rather than risks whereas companies and individuals are concerned about how to respond quickly and what damage it poses to them. (spring at el. 2021) JFrog identified significant discrepancy in the vulnerabilities and observed that 10 prevalent vulnerabilities of 2022 has low rating in terms of their severity but had high impact on the enterprises hence it fails to determine the actual impact. (Charlie, 2023)
Alternatives to CVSS
The Author from Spring at el. suggested Skate holder-specific vulnerability categorization addresses approaches that CVSS failed to identify. (Spring at el. 2021) The SSVC adds five values such as exploitation of the vulnerability, technical impact of exploiting a vulnerability, automating steps of cyber kill chain model to automate exploits events, take account criticality of the asset of the organization and lastly, recognises the impact of affected system on public well-being. (Payal, 2022)
In conclusion, CVSS needs a revamp or new system needs to be put in place in order to recognise to eliminate the deficiencies in the existing vulnerability management process.
